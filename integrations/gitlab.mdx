### Prerequisites

If you are using a **Self-Managed GitLab** instance (hosted on-premise or in a private cloud), you must ensure Refacto can communicate with your server.

<Info>
  **Allowlist Refacto IP**

  Please configure your firewall or security group inbound rules to whitelist the following IP address to ensure uninterrupted connectivity:

  **`3.131.112.244`**
</Info>

Follow these steps to connect Refacto to your GitLab workspace.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integrations" icon="window">
    - Navigate to the **Integrations** page in your Refacto dashboard.
    - Click **Connect** on **GitLab**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Personal Access Token" icon="key">
    You need to create a **GitLab Personal Access Token** with appropriate permissions.

    ⚠️ You must have **Administrator / Owner access** to the GitLab group or instance to generate API tokens and create webhooks.

    1. Log in to **GitLab** with an account having Owner/Admin permissions.
    2. Navigate to **User Profile → Preferences → Access Tokens**, or open directly: https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens
    3. Under **Create a personal access token**, fill in the following:
       - **Token name**: `Refacto Integration`
       - **Expiration date**: Recommended **180–360 days**
    4. Under **Select scopes**, enable the following required scopes:

       | Scope             | Mandatory | Purpose                                                                                                                  | If Missing                                               |
       | :---------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
       | `read_user`       | ✅ Yes     | Provides access to user identity and account details. Used to correctly attribute commits, merge requests, and comments. | User attribution and reviewer mapping will fail.         |
       | `read_repository` | ✅ Yes     | Allows read access to repositories, branches, and code required for merge request analysis.                              | Refacto cannot fetch code or diffs for review.           |
       | `read_api`        | ✅ Yes     | Grants access to GitLab APIs to fetch projects, groups, merge requests, and pipeline metadata.                           | Repository and MR metadata cannot be retrieved.          |
       | `read_registry`   | ✅ Yes     | Enables access to container registry metadata when repositories reference images.                                        | Image-related context will be unavailable.               |
       | `api`             | ✅ Yes     | Required to create and manage webhooks and to post automated review comments on merge requests.                          | Webhooks won’t trigger and Refacto cannot post feedback. |
    5. Review the selected scopes and click **Create personal access token**.

    <Note>
      **Important:** Copy the generated token immediately. It will be shown only once.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the Setup Form" icon="check">
    On the GitLab setup page in Refacto, enter the following details:

    - **GitLab Instance URL** – (e.g., `https://gitlab.com` or your self-managed GitLab URL).
    - **Personal Access Token** – The token you generated in the previous step.

    Click **Save & Sync Repositories** to complete the setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done" icon="party-horn">
    Your GitLab integration is now active. Refacto will automatically:

    - Discover repositories
    - Create required webhooks
    - Start analyzing merge requests
  </Step>
