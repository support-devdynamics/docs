    Refacto can automatically review a pull request when it's opened.

    This feature is off by default. To turn it on, follow these steps:

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        Navigate to the [Settings](https://app.refacto.ai/settings) page in the Refacto app.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        Find the **Auto Review** option and toggle it **ON**.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    <Tip>
      Once enabled, every new PR is reviewed automatically — perfect for consistent, hands-free checks.

    You can also trigger reviews manually by adding a comment in a PR:

    ```text
    @refacto-bot
    ```

    <Tip>
      Perfect for running reviews **only when you need them**, giving you full control over which PRs get checked.
