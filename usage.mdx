## Triggering PR Reviews

Refacto-bot supports two ways to trigger reviews for your pull requests.

<Card title="Auto Review" icon="bolt">
Refacto can automatically review every pull request for you.  

By default, Auto Review is **OFF**. To enable it, go to **Settings** in the Refacto app and toggle **Auto Review** ON.  

<Tip>
Once enabled, every PR is reviewed automatically â€” perfect for consistent, hands-free checks.

You can also trigger reviews manually by adding a comment in a PR:

<CodeBlock language="text">
/refacto-bot
</CodeBlock>

<Tip>
Perfect for running reviews **only when you need them**, giving you full control over which PRs get checked.
