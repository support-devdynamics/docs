### Auto Review

Automatically reviews PRs when they are opened.

- **Default:** OFF
- **Enable:** Go to **Settings** in Refacto and toggle **Auto Review** ON.

_Enable this if you want reviews to happen automatically without manual intervention._

### PR Summary

Adds a summarized view of the PR in review comments.

_This helps reviewers quickly understand the changes and context._

### Sequence Diagram

Generates a sequence diagram for code changes.

_Visualize the flow of your code to make reviews easier and faster._

### Scope and Precedence

You can configure settings at **Organization Level** or **Repository Level**:

- **Organization Level:** Default settings applied to all repositories.
- **Repository Level:** Custom settings for individual repositories override organization-level defaults.

_Repository settings take priority over organization defaults._
