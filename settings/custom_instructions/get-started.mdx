<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Custom Instructions" icon="compass">
    - Navigate to **Refacto → Settings → Custom Instructions**.
    - You’ll see two tabs:
      - **PR Review** – controls how the AI analyzes pull requests.
      - **Custom Instructions** – lets you define rules and coding standards using YAML.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose How to Start" icon="file-plus">
    You can begin in two ways:

    - **Load Example & Get Started** – creates a sample YAML with one org rule and two repo rules.
    - **Start from Scratch** – starts with an empty config.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Template" icon="pencil">
    When you load the example, a YAML editor opens with three prefilled blocks (1 org, 2 repo-specific).

    You can click **Add Repository** to insert a new block.

    | Field              | Description                 | Example                              |
    | ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
    | `match.paths`      | Regex to match file paths   | `src/java*`                          |
    | `match.extensions` | File extensions to include  | `.ts, .js`                           |
    | `instructions`     | The actual review rule text | `"All PRs must include unit tests."` |

    <Note>
      Only the content under instructions counts toward the 500-character limit per block.
