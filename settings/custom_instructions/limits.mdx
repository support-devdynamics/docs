## Limits and Validation

### Character Limits
- 500 characters per block
- 4000 characters total per YAML

### YAML Format Rules
- YAML 1.2 compliant
- 2-space indentation, no tabs
- Allowed root fields: `version`, `language`, `org`, `repos`

### Validation Requirements
- At least one instruction required
- Repo names: alphanumeric, `_` or `-` only
- Up to 10 repos, 20 items per `match` array

### Security Checks
- Avoid terms like “ignore above”, “override”, “forget previous”
- Don’t include text that alters AI behavior or review logic

<Note>
  These safeguards ensure consistent and safe PR reviews.
