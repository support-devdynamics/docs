## Update or Resubmit

You’ll need to update your YAML when:

- Repo structure or coding standards change
- A submission was previously rejected

### To resubmit:

1. Open your existing YAML config
2. Edit only the changed block(s)
3. Select updated or rejected blocks
4. Click **Submit for Review**

Approved blocks stay active until the new version is approved.  
Rejected blocks display a **“Rejection Reason”**.

<Note>
  Avoid flagged words like “ignore above”, “override”, or “bypass”. Keep YAML syntax valid with 2-space indents.
