  <Step title="Submit for Review" icon="upload">
    Below the editor, you’ll find a summary table showing:

    - Character usage per block
    - Status (No Status, Approved, In Review, Rejected)
    - Rejection reason (if any)

    Select blocks to send for approval and click **Submit & Apply**.

    | Status    | Meaning                                      |
    | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | No status | Not yet submitted                            |
    | In Review | Under validation (usually a few days)        |
    | Approved  | Instructions are active                      |
    | Rejected  | Invalid or security violation (reason shown) |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Rules in PRs" icon="eye">
    When Refacto reviews a PR, it posts a summary comment with:

    - **Applied Instructions** – which rules were used
    - **Unapplied Instructions** – skipped rules and reasons (e.g., repo mismatch)

    <Note>
      Once approved, your rules automatically apply to all matching PRs across the organization.

  <Step title="Update or Resubmit" icon="arrows-rotate-reverse">
    You’ll need to update your YAML when:

    - Repo structure or coding standards change
    - A submission was previously rejected

    To resubmit:

    1. Open your existing YAML config
    2. Edit only the changed block(s)
    3. Select updated or rejected blocks
    4. Click **Submit for Review**

    Approved blocks stay active until the new version is approved.\
    Rejected blocks display a “Rejection Reason”.

    <Note>
      Avoid flagged words like “ignore above”, “override”, or “bypass”. Keep YAML syntax valid with 2-space indents.
